Both programs can be run on the Windows and Linux machines.

Test_1.py unfortuantely requires changing hard-codded values (I did not mange my time good enough to take care of createing a function that would read & verify user input values). The syntax to run Test_1.py on both, Windows and Linux machines is as follows:

  python Test_1.py


When it comes to Test_02.py it gets a search directory as an argument of function (not enough time to verify if the syntax is correct, but in the perfect world it should be verified), and the syntex to both, Windows and Linux machines is as follows:

  python Test_2.py <initial_search_directory>
  
i.e. python Test_2.py /usr/src/doc
